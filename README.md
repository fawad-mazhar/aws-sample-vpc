## Overview
This repository contains a sample VPC configuration.

This vpc configuration is laid down with the following assumptions:
 - There will be upto 5 regional deployments
 - Per region we will have approximately 6 subnets, 3 private and 3 public.
 - The network address space would start from `10.16.0.0/16` onwards and upwards till `10.127.255.255/16` leaving behind enough address space for spare subnets and possibly emerging new availability zones.


#### Important Note
This deployment incurs cost.
